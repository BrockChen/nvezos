**HOWTO: Update v.6**

Here are instructions on how to updaten to v.6 if you already have NvEZOS installed, otherwise, for a fresh install, you can ignore update.sh

1. SSH to miner via a utility like putty or mobaxterm. You can download putty here - https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html

2. To connect with putty, simply enter your miner IP and hit open, you will be prompted with an RSA validation, hit yes, then login to the ssh session with the account you setup during install.

3. Execute the following commands.

sudo mkdir /nvupdate/

cd /nvupdate/

sudo git clone https://github.com/thendawg/nvezos.git

cd nvezos/

sudo chmod +x update.sh

sudo ./update.sh

4. Thats it! Sorry for the cumbersome update process, I plan to add a WebUI function for this down the road.
